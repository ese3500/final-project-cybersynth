# Alex and Victor ESE 3500 Final Project


main.c --> Code runnning the main arduino responsible for UART MIDI and reading sensor values
DISPLAY_main.c --> Code running the secondary arduino respondible for the LCD display

All other files are libraries

## HOW TO COMPILE:

This project utilized two Arduinos. The main.c file must be flashed onto the primary arduino that is connected to the sensors + pots. The DISPLAY_main.c file must be flashed onto the secondary arduino connected to the LCD display. The remainder files should all accompany **BOTH** main files for each of them to compile.
